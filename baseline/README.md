## The Implementation of Baseline Method

- [LingoLoop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14493): Based on the introduction in the original paper, we implemented this method **ourselves** as there was no open-source code.

- [Verbose Sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16557): The paper introduces the verbose image and verbose video methods, and we have implemented the them method based on their open-source code.

## Acknowledgements
The implementation of baseline is mainly based on [Verbose_Images](https://github.com/KuofengGao/Verbose_Images). Thanks for their wonderful works!
